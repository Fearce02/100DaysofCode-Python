#GameRules

#the Goal of the game is to add up to the highest number without going over 21
#if its added to a number more than 21 then its called a BUST.which means you lose immediately
#all the cards that range from 2-10 are counted as their face value. Which means 2 = 2, 6= 6, 9=9
#the Jack, king and Queen each count as 10
#the ace can go from 1 to 11 depending on the value of your 21. you can decide its value
